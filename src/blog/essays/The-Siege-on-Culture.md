On the banks of the Kali Gandaki lies perhaps the most serene sight in all of Palpa.
Travelers to Tansen can scarcely resist the urge to stop at the opposite bank, for on certain sunsets, the castle becomes becomes a silhouette that serenades the soul, speaking with a sight beyond human comprehension. And yet, unbeknownst to them, scarce few steps away, a bloody battle rages.

“I’m losing the war”, an ancient artisan grumbles “I, and I alone carve these Karuwas with hands - the young’ns have succumbed to the smothering tentacles of technology”. His withering palms smell of steel and ash; one cannot imagine how they’ve survived fifty years of this slow siege that modern methods have laid on raw talent.

“The old man is a raging lunatic!”, A young’n in Tansen exclaims ,“I’d take a hefty loss ahead of anything that old oaf is going through.” He isn’t as unkempt as the artist was, but one cannot help but sense a hint of envy in his voice. “Ah okay, he’s good at what he does, but have you seen how long he takes? I mean, c’mon, this is a job, not a passion project.”

The war has raged on for an eternity. Every so often in the olden days, there would come a great new discovery, a storm on the walls that would wipe the withering castle away and see new men settling on the city. But another bunch of soldiers would lay their camp not soon after, and more would join them. Slowly but surely, an army would build, and the young’ns would topple the old oafs yet again. 

The earth would go from round to flat to round again, and the eternal war would forever be waged.
And yet, the world has grown less conservative over the years, and the besieged have started making friends with the one besieging them. But in places such as this, the aged artists fear for their thousand year old craft, refusing to bow down to the will of time.

But if there’s one lesson that can can be learnt from history, it is that time is the ultimate besieger. One can run from time, but cannot escape it. In this part of the world, people such as the ancient artisan have resisted for far too long. The last stand, it seems, is coming to an end.

“I’ve spent blood, sweat and tears doing this, I won’t succumb to the mediocrity of automation just because it’s ‘convenient’, take your levers with you, and shove it up that young’n’s backside for me”
“The old oaf’s living in Medieval times, there’s no Kings that give you vast swaths of land for a single Karuwa carving, the common man doesn’t want the most beautiful arc-shape in all the seven seas, he wants something modest but good. What he makes is not ancient enough for the museums, and too extravagant for the public – there’s no point in not yielding.”

“Mark my words - the young’n will be fighting the same war with his grandsons.”
The besiegers storm the walls, and the whole structure comes crashing down.

A new day now dawns. The sun shines on the horizon, and one spies a strange silhouette approaching.

Far beyond the Tansen hills, a thick speckeled man enters a title into his word processor - “Automating Management”

The siege would carry on.
