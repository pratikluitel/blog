Steven Smith screamed.

For a solid seventeen days he had held his guard — a seemingly impregnable fortress, the solitary wall against spells of sly, specious bowling. Australia’s lone savior had stood vigil as his teammates collapsed around him.

But reckoning had come. Jofra Archer had come.

And he had made Steven Smith scream.

He was steaming in with all the fury in the world. Smith could spy him from the corner of his eye — Jofra Archer, the wonder kid, his dreadlocks drooping from the sides of his face, his gold chain hanging around his neck, the red, chiseled cherry gripped tight in his palms, and his eyes fixated on a spot on the pitch Smith could barely discern.

The wonder kid swiftly approached the bowling crease, the red dukes ball perched atop his outstretched right arm, ten feet from the ground, Steven Smith taking guard at the other end.

The ball now had a mind of its own. It came hurling down onto the pitch at ninety three miles an hour, leaping off it at the same pace, heading straight towards Steven Smith’s face.

The day had been hostile, with Archer hurling 150 kph thunderbolts on one end, and Broad getting plenty of purchase from the pitch from the other. The ball bounced at uneven angles, diagonal movement off the pitch seemed abundant, and the usually dull, posh crowd at Lord’s seemed to mimic the conditions — hostile and noisy.

But Steven Smith had endured.
He’d dug in, grinding bowlers into the grass, making eighty valuable runs on a surface where scoring seemed a damnably difficult chore. He’d confronted the demons from the year past, burying the sandpaper menace in a memory warded off from the rest of his mind.

He’d been in the zone — the frame of mind where one was so stuck to the task, so singularly focused that the psyche refused to budge from what it wanted to focus on. He’d been in the zone for seventeen consecutive days.

Tabloid headlines on him had gone from “Disgraceful Cheat” to “Best since Sir Donald Bradman”, and one could scarcely deny that he was a generational talent.
But all the talent in the world can’t save one from a bouncer aimed at his head, hurled at him from a ten foot high slingshot at ninety three miles an hour. Steven Smith had withstood the siege for seventeen days straight, but falls from grace seldom took that long.

The ball pinned him on the neck. A synapse broke.
The body came tumbling down onto the pitch, and Lord’s came to a standstill. The crowd hushed, their mouths agape — blows like that could kill, and the manner in which Steven Smith fell, his stuttered hands flailing, was concerning. The team physios hurried to the middle, the Australian dressing room looked visibly shaken.

On the pitch, Steven Smith’s head was ringing. The seventeen day siege, it seemed, had come to an end. Jofra had been promised a hostile introduction by the Australians before the game began. The Australians were now facing his wrath.

And Jofra Archer was snickering. Steven Smith lay on the ground, half conscious, his head ringing from the blow, yet he could hear the faint titter with the greatest clarity in the world. Jofra Archer had bounced him, he’d bamboozled him with a short ball on the head, pinned him down, the prospect of a concussion looming on the horizon, and there he was, unconcerned, laughing like it was the funniest thing he’d ever seen on a cricket pitch.

Steven Smith limped off the ground into the dressing room, and the posh crowd at Lord’s booed him. Booed a man who’d been Australia’s savior for seventeen days straight, who’d stood shoulders above everyone else the last fortnight. They booed a man who averaged 63 runs every innings — the best since Bradman. They booed a man who was on road to scoring three consecutive centuries since his comeback from the ban.

They booed a disgrace — a cheat who was going to let his whole country down once again.

Steven Smith screamed. A thousand bells rang in harmony inside his head. If it was hostility Lord’s wanted, Smith would serve it to them. The long drawn out siege had ended. The walls had fallen. It was either assault, or perish.

Steven Smith stood, still screaming. He put the armor of his thigh pads on, and pulled his bat from his scabbard-shaped bag.

He was Steven Peter Devereux Smith, the best since Bradman. Concussions be damned — he wouldn’t go down without a fight.
