In times like these  
I think of then  
Of what became,  
What could have been  
<br/>
In dire times  
In times awry  
When days of doom and gloom are nigh;  
I think of when the sky was blue  
I think of then  
I think of you  
<br/>
I think of never, evermore  
Of all that is and was before  
Of things that were, that came to be  
I think of you  
I think of me  
<br/>
Of shrieking stars that spoke of hay -  
Whence sun would shine, and shine away  
Of worlds that would be built anew  
I think of then  
I think of you  
<br/>
Of legends lost, lunged to shame  
Of heroes they never became  
Of aimless tales that rang untrue  
I think of them  
I think of you  
<br/>
In times like these  
I think of then  
I think of when it all began  
Itâ€™s in these times  
I wait for then  
I pray to wait for you again
