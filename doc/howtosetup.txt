SETTING UP A WEBSERVER TO SERVE UP CONTENT AND RESPOND DYNAMICALLY USING GULP

4. If you don't have gulp, install gulp  globally 
$ sudo npm install -g gulp-cli

5. Now install gulp locally using save-dev so it is added to package.json
$ npm install --save-dev gulp-cli

6. Install gulp-sass (dynamically compiles scss to css) and browser-sync (name is evident I think) using npm (locally)
7. Install del(to delete/clean the distribution(dist) folder), gulp-imagemin(to reduce image size), 
gulp-uglify (uglifies js code, removes spaces to reduce overhead), gulp-clean-css(does same but for css),gulp-htmlmin(same for html),gulp-usemin (combines all js, css files into html to reduce space), gulp-flatmap, gulp-rev(adds hashes to filenames so cached pages don't cause conflict) through npm locally

$ npm install gulp-uglify gulp-usemin gulp-rev gulp-clean-css gulp-flatmap gulp-htmlmin --save-dev
