Open source code for personal blog.
Uses jekyll, with a custom minimalistic theme. It isn't too modular, but I plan on making it somewhat modular.
Is gulp compatible, so building another site with this should be fairly straightforward. 
Will add some tutorials to this later.
See /doc/ for how it was built.
